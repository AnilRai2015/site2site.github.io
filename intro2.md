### Office_US_

This course will partner with the seminar, _Corporate Avant Garde_, by taking a hypothetical construct as its object: an architecture office installed at the US Pavilion of the Venice Biennale this summer, Office_US_. This office will present a new environment and methodology for the practice of architecture. Inhabited by working architects, it will be a live prototype for testing ideas in public, admist the highest biannual concentration of architects.

### Interface

Our contribution will be to design and build both the interface by which these architects will practice, and simultaneously the new tools they will use to create a new type of architecture. We will use digital technologies - both web-based and physical - to create a responsive environment, and a platform for the architects inhabiting this environment to produce similarly responsive architectures around the world.

### Office_Us_

To do so, we will work as an office ourselves and test our creations through the Studio-X Global Network.


### Why? Because architects need to practice in new ways.

### Technology today provides the archetypal model for innovation.

Internally, technology firms work collaboratively. They also build upon the work of others, and open source their own work for others to use. They simultaneously employ a local and a remote, distributed, virtual workforce. They integrate teaching and learning, public events and exhibitions, publishing and other forms of discursive production and engagement into both their workflow and their bottom line. 


One of the principal goals is to become a platform

Flickr famously did this in 2004


Their approach was to provide an API


Apple also did so with the iPhone, providing hardware and an operating system


The platform wars we know so well are migrating to architecture. The winners will determine the meta-conditions of how we will practice architecture in the near future.
