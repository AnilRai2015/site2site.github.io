# Assignment 1

## Programs/Apps

Each student is responsible to propose one local program/app for Studio-X NYC, and one global program/app to connect two or more spaces across the Studio-X Global Network.

To begin, fork the [Global Surround Sound](!!!) repository as a template. Change the name of the global-surround-sound folder to the name of your program/app (in lowercase, using dashes to separate words), and use the scenario.md file as a template for the assignment below. Do this twice: once for your local app, once for your global.

Each program/app must include:

*	a name for the program/app
*	a short, single sentence description
*	a programmatic category (design, exhibition, event, etc., see [/programs/index.md](/programs/index.md) for a complete list - add a new programmatic category to this file if necessary)
*	an illustrated narrative scenario (details below)
*	a diagram showing the functional relationship between objects (details below)
*	a collection of objects and the sensors/actuators/materials they will employ (details below)


### The Scenario

The scenario is the principal means by which you will simultaneously pitch your program/app and describe it's function, utility and the change in the use of space you expect as a result of it's installment. The scenario should be illustrated. You can do so with found images or by creating your own and uploading to the /images directory in your program/app directory. At minimum, the scenario must include:

*	a high level description of how the program/app will work
*	where the program/app fits along the programmatic spectrum
*	a list of the objects it will employ and any key sensors/actuators/materials they will use
*	a diagram of how the objects will be connected together

When you are finished, add your program/app to the [Program Index](/programs/index.md). Complete this process for a local program/app and a global program/app.


### The Objects

For each of the objects you propose, you will need to add them to the course Object Index. To begin, make a copy of the [Hand-held Event Microphone](/objects/hand-held-event-microphone) folder as a template. Change the name of the hand-held-event-microphone folder to the name of your object (in lowercase, using dashes to separate words), and use the object.md file as a template for documenting your object. Do this for each object. Your app should specify as many connected objects as you deem necessary, but you are only responsible for adding a maximum of three to the Object Index.

When you are finished, add your object to the [Object Index](/objects/index.md).


## Aesthetics

A key consideration throughout this course will be on aesthetics. In order to operate on the architecture imaginary - specifically, on the way architects think - we must avoid using the visual rhetoric of futurology. One polemic of the course is that architecture is online, already. It must be registered throughout the production of the course that the work we are doing is simply catching architecture up to the present state of technology, rather than projecting a forecast into the distant future.


## Studio-X NYC Visit and Collective Database

Each student is requested to visit Studio-X NYC before the week 2 class session and take photos of the space in general, and details of whichever elements the student thinks they may eventually wish to hack. Please upload these images to the [Studio-X photos folder](/locations/Studio-X%20NYC/photos).

Each student is also requested to collect at least one 3D model in .STL format of an object in Studio-X, or an object their program/app specifies. This model can come from any source, or be self-generated, though they must provide a license that will allow others to use them free of charge for any activity (equivalent to the MIT license).

## Deadlines and Collective Critique

Each program/app scenario and contributions to the Object Index must be online by 11:59pm on Tuesday, September 10, 2013.

By noon on Thursday, September 12, 2013, each student must have offered comments to exactly - no more, no less - one other student, on both their local and global app. You will do this by forking each of their repositories, adding a Critique section to the bottom of both scenario.md files, and adding your comments here. You will then issue a pull request on both repositories. The student who created the original repository will then accept your pull request and merge your changes into their master branch.
