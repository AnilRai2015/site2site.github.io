## Modalities of Contribution

### There are three principal types of contribution


*	![create something](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/lectures/week1/contribution_structure0.png)

### You can create an object.


*	![contribute](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/lectures/week1/contribution_structure1.png)

### You can contribute to an object that already exists.


*	![clone](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/lectures/week1/contribution_structure2.png)

### Or, you can clone an object that exists and turn it into an new object.

### This will allow us to begin to build a constellation of objects with multiple contributors.

### We will expand horizontally with objects that do similar things

*	![vertical](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/lectures/week1/contribution_structure5.png)

### and verically, by creating interfaces between objects that do different things.

*	![tree up](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/lectures/week1/contribution_structure6.png)

### We will build these up to create stacks of objects of greater abstraction

*	![tree down](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/lectures/week1/contribution_structure7.png)

### and build them down to create stacks of objects with greater physicality.

### And then stitch these stacks together to build our platform.

### or it may be complex.

### It will certainly be unique to you.
