## Rule Nº1

### If you think this is still interesting

![Pope media comparison](http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2013/03/comparison1.jpg)

### you might think [this](http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/a-prompt-for-architectural-theory) is interesting.

### But you would be repeating the formula of modern architecture.

### This is a category mistake: communication technology evolves by a different logic than mechanical technology.

> 	“Communications tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring.”  
	-Clay Shirky, _Here Comes Everybody_

### We will limit our techno-obsessions to the banal.



## Why?

*	![Wired Like Magic](http://www.wired.com/design/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ff_experienceDesign_1025.jpg)

>	"Within the next five years we will be surrounded by embedded devices and services."
	-Cliff Kuang, [Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/08/design-and-the-digital-world/), August 2013

### This timeline is incommensurate with the classic model of innovation in architecture: avant garde experiments, corporate slowly assimilates.

*	![Corporate vs. Avant Garde](http://workbench.cadenhead.org/media/apple-pc-mac-people.jpg)


### To break down this formula we will consciously operate on both the architecture imaginary and architecture practice.




## Practice

>	"You could say that one definition of architecture is anything with furniture in it."
	-Mark Wigley

### To put it another way, architecture is produced with furniture.

*	![Architecture Firm](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Architects-office.jpg)

### Designing the furniture of the architecture office produces a reflexive situation and a series of boundary problems, problematizing the fundamentals architecture practice.

### Representation, documentation, fabrication, materials, workflow, protocols, systems, product design, interaction design, convention design... you will chose which domain or domains you want to contribute to, and your mode of contribution.





## Representation

### Architecture has harboured many flavors of technological fetish.

### The aesthetics of techno-fetishism have the capacity to sever architecture from technological reality.

>	"We will no longer say experiment, laboratory, global."
	-Mark Wigley

### How can we normalize technology through representation?

### Can we combine speculation and realism in techno-aesthetics?

### This is not a new idea.

### But its conditions of possibility are historically new.
