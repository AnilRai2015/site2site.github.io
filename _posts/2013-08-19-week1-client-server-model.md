*   If you have your own computer, install all of the software listed on the Software page of this wiki. If you do not, you can do all of the work of the class using the software on the GSAPP machines and through the browser. For instance, rather than using Sublime Text 2 for text editing, you can either use Adobe Dreamweaver, or write your code directly in the online editor provided by Github (the preferred method).
